# Knockout pager 
A pager for use with knockout. 

For now, see the example's source for how to use it. I added some comments to the code.

## Example
See a working example at: http://remcoros.github.com/ko.pager/example.html


## Dependencies
I used jquery and bootstrap to style it a bit. ko.pager.js has no dependency on those. But you will have to add the css classes to your stylesheet or modify the template.


## Documentation

Wiki: https://github.com/remcoros/ko.pager/wiki
The wiki is a draft, if anyone wants I can spend some more time on this.
